You need to install automake (pkgin install automake) to configure netcat source code

Commands to build and install:
$ git clone git://github.com/xcodevn/minix3-netcat.git
$ cd minix3-netcat/netcat/src
$ make
$ make install

Have fun :-)

P/S: this patch is a dummy patch of netcat on minix3, improvement will come in the future!
